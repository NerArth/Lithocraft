In terms of development, content addition for blocks will probably take the longest with regards to time, because there will be many variants to tweak and create for several cases.

  "lithocraft:lithocraft4rooms-title": "Medieval Industry 04: Base-building suggestions",
  "lithocraft:lithocraft4rooms-text": "Because of <a href=\"handbooksearch://Medieval Industry\">Medieval Industry</a>'s new items and processes, some dedicated room suggestions are outlined in this chapter.\n\n<strong>Barrel cottage</strong>\n\nVintage Story already has many liquids and MI's Chemistry module adds even more. A room or building purpose-built to hold many barrels then becomes a good idea, especially when fitted with even a small amount of item storage such as a storage vessel for spare buckets to move fluids around. To begin with, a suggested room layout for a small to medium-scale operation would be to build an internal space 6 blocks wide and 12 blocks long. This space should ideally be 3 blocks high, while allowing for some holes in the floor.\n\nThe premise is simple, lay out some flooring so that you have only two single rows of flooring, one at the second row and another at the fifth row. Fill the empty gaps with barrels, making sure the barrel foundations are solid if you play with instabilities, in case you want to make alterations or build something beneath the room, like a basement or cellar.\n\nYour building should now have this repeating pattern on its width-axis and along its length-axis: BFBBFB, where B is barrel and F is flooring. You may replace the Bs with Fs at the length ends of the building if you wish to have a bit more flooring, such that your ends would look like FFFFFF while the rest of the building was BFBBFB. On top of Bs, you can have horizontal slabs of any material and make those slabs carry another barrel, making for a very compact space with high barrel density.\n\nIn this example, you end up with 8 rows (4 at floor level, 4 at head level) of 12 or 10 barrels each, totalling between 80 and 96 barrels. In addition, an advantage to this scheme is that you can dedicate each row for a specific end-product; so you may have a limewater row, a weak tannin row, a strong tannin row, and so on. By saving a single row as not being dedicated to one type of liquid, you can use this spare row for moving spare amounts of liquid from a dedicated row, until the point at which you have a full barrel from leftover amounts from a dedicated row, a trouble one often runs into when tanning leather.\n\n<strong>Distillery</strong>\n\nFor small home-brewing and liquid processing, rather than cram a distillation still into an already jam-packed room, why not create a dedicated room for it? A suggested internal layout for this room would be a space that is 3-5 blocks wide, 3-5 blocks long and 3 blocks high. Firstly lay down full flooring of your choice. Then, place a distillation boiler on the middle block of floor that is against any of the walls that doesn't have a door on it. Then, attach 1-3 condensers to the sides of the boiler as may best suit your needs; the free space in the room could be put to use with shelves or storage for specific things needed when making use of the room. This room or an expanded version of it might be well-purposed when attached to a barrel cottage.",

  "lithocraft:lithocraft5bauxite-title": "Medieval Industry 05: Bauxite processing",
  "lithocraft:lithocraft5bauxite-text": "Bauxite refinement is a complicated process and <a href=\"handbooksearch://Medieval Industry\">Medieval Industry</a> mostly bases this on the Deville process.\n\n<strong>Process:</strong>\nFirst, sodash (sodium carbonate) must be produced by dry-mixing salt, sulfuric compounds, lime and carbon into an even mix.\n\nThen, the sodash must be mixed with some form of bauxite, usually sand; the resulting prepared bauxite grit must be heated to 1300C using a suitable fuel. This produces saluminate (aluminium salts).\n\nThe saluminate is mixed with limewater in a barrel, making an alum slurry.\n\nThe slurry is then processed by distillation with a boiler/condenser set-up and to yield a purer alum solution.\n\nThe alum solution has to be left to stand to dry in a barrel, leaving behind aluox (impure aluminium oxide dusts).\n\nThe aluox must be heated to at least 500C to burn off impurities and convert it into the purer aluminium oxide, alumina. The alumina is a truer raw material form of aluminium.\n\nThe alumina can then be used as nuggets would be used, smelted in a crucible or used in alloying.",

  "lithocraft:lithocraft99tweaks-text": "<strong>Tweaks made by Medieval Industry:</strong>\n\n- Gravel, sand and loose stones can be made from other full blocks with the use of a <a href=\"handbooksearch://pickaxe\">pickaxe</a> or <a href=\"handbooksearch://sieve\">sieve</a> as applicable in the crafting grid; check a handbook entry for any pickaxe or the sieve to see more details.\n\n- Candles may now be crafted using mineral wax and peat bricks.\n\n- Charcoal, brown coal, coal and peat bricks can now be used in clay ovens. (will still look like firewood when inside)\n\n-Potash can now be made from crushed alum and powdered sulfur using a sieve.\n\n-Any full blocks of ungraded ore (ungraded being things like coal, alum, sylvite and many more) can be placed in a crafting grid with a pickaxe for better yields; consult any <a href=\"handbooksearch://pickaxe\">pickaxe</a> for more details.\n\n- Container textures are made available for a variety of different loose materials, so that you can identify loose stones, coal, peat and more, in open crates.\n\n- Peat burning time is greatly increased.\n\n- Adds a missing full block for stone roofing where applicable.\n\n- Many blocks and certain items made of stone can now be deconstructed in crafting recipes, for example dry stone fences can be turned back into the stone they were made of.",
