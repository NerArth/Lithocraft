    "lithocraft:lithocraft4rooms-title": "Medieval Industry 04: Base-building suggestions",
    "lithocraft:lithocraft4rooms-text": "NOTE: This page needs to be reworked or removed.<br><br>Because of <a href=\"handbooksearch://Medieval Industry\">Medieval Industry</a>'s new items and processes, some dedicated room suggestions are outlined in this chapter.<br><br><strong>Barrel cottage</strong><br><br>Vintage Story already has many liquids and MI's Chemistry module adds even more. A room or building purpose-built to hold many barrels then becomes a good idea, especially when fitted with even a small amount of item storage such as a storage vessel for spare buckets to move fluids around. To begin with, a suggested room layout for a small to medium-scale operation would be to build an internal space 6 blocks wide and 12 blocks long. This space should ideally be 3 blocks high, while allowing for some holes in the floor.<br><br>The premise is simple, lay out some flooring so that you have only two single rows of flooring, one at the second row and another at the fifth row. Fill the empty gaps with barrels, making sure the barrel foundations are solid if you play with instabilities, in case you want to make alterations or build something beneath the room, like a basement or cellar.<br><br>Your building should now have this repeating pattern on its width-axis and along its length-axis: BFBBFB, where B is barrel and F is flooring. You may replace the Bs with Fs at the length ends of the building if you wish to have a bit more flooring, such that your ends would look like FFFFFF while the rest of the building was BFBBFB. On top of Bs, you can have horizontal slabs of any material and make those slabs carry another barrel, making for a very compact space with high barrel density.<br><br>In this example, you end up with 8 rows (4 at floor level, 4 at head level) of 12 or 10 barrels each, totalling between 80 and 96 barrels. In addition, an advantage to this scheme is that you can dedicate each row for a specific end-product; so you may have a limewater row, a weak tannin row, a strong tannin row, and so on. By saving a single row as not being dedicated to one type of liquid, you can use this spare row for moving spare amounts of liquid from a dedicated row, until the point at which you have a full barrel from leftover amounts from a dedicated row, a trouble one often runs into when tanning leather.<br><br><strong>Distillery</strong><br><br>For small home-brewing and liquid processing, rather than cram a distillation still into an already jam-packed room, why not create a dedicated room for it? A suggested internal layout for this room would be a space that is 3-5 blocks wide, 3-5 blocks long and 3 blocks high. Firstly lay down full flooring of your choice. Then, place a distillation boiler on the middle block of floor that is against any of the walls that doesn't have a door on it. Then, attach 1-3 condensers to the sides of the boiler as may best suit your needs; the free space in the room could be put to use with shelves or storage for specific things needed when making use of the room. This room or an expanded version of it might be well-purposed when attached to a barrel cottage.",

    "lithocraft:lithocraft5bauxite-text": "Bauxite refinement is a complicated process, added in the <a href=\"handbooksearch://Medieval Industry (Metal)\">Medieval Industry (Metallurgy)</a> module.<br><br>Here in the mod, this is mostly based on the Deville process.<br><br><strong>Process:</strong><br>First, sodash (sodium carbonate) must be produced by dry-mixing salt, sulfuric compounds, lime and carbon into an even mix.<br><br>Then, the sodash must be mixed with some form of bauxite, usually sand; the resulting prepared bauxite grit must be heated to 1300C using a suitable fuel. This produces saluminate (aluminium salts).<br><br>The saluminate is mixed with limewater in a barrel, making an alum slurry.<br><br>The slurry is then processed by distillation with a boiler/condenser set-up and to yield a purer alum solution.<br><br>The alum solution has to be left to stand to dry in a barrel, leaving behind aluox (impure aluminium oxide dusts).<br><br>The aluox must be heated to at least 500C to burn off impurities and convert it into the purer aluminium oxide, alumina. The alumina is a truer raw material form of aluminium.<br><br>The alumina can then be used as nuggets would be used, smelted in a crucible or used in alloying.",

    "game:trivia-stonepainting": "Much like writing, artwork has been part of human expressive nature for many ages. In more recent times it has been thought, and sometimes shown, that some of the earliest depictions known of anything whatsoever really did not serve aesthetic purposes in the way we think of art now, and were more likely simply meant to transmit information in the same way that a highway pictogram does, as a sign of something literal and tangible.<br><br>Imagined and aesthetic depictions of folklore and other gestalt-type phenomenons really came into being much later and are typically associated with the so-called ancient cultures of the world, such as the regions modernly associated with Greece, Egypt, China and other cultures of ancient legacy.<br><br>Paintings and indeed art in general, have progressively refined both in cultural and technical terms as technologies and processes became more advanced.<br><br>All of the paintings added by <a href=\"handbooksearch://Medieval Industry\">Medieval Industry</a> are my own original creations, some are references, most are just something nice to look at.<br><br>The mod adds many paintings, most of them can be acquired or crafted in different ways.

    "game:tip-stonepainting": "ALL paintings can be crafted or acquired from a furniture trader, however, some paintings are deliberately hidden from the handbook, in effect making their recipes secret."
