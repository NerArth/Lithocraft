### 2.1 License Version Notice
This custom license is versioned and may be updated in future releases to clarify terms or improve protections. However, any use of the mod under a previous version of the license remains valid under that version's terms. Users are encouraged to review the license included with each release.

### 2.2 Scope
All original art assets created by NerArth (the Author), including but not limited to creative writing, trivia, textures, models, icons, and visual elements within the published releases **OR** under the `LithocraftDevAssets` **OR** under other development directories, are licensed under the following terms:

#### a. Permitted Uses

These assets **may** be reused or modified **only** for the purpose of:

1. Contributing to this mod project;
    
2. Creating compatibility patches with other mods;
    
3. Making custom additions that relate to or extend this mod, within the context of Vintage Story modding;

4. Personal use of the mod as expected through normal use of the gameplay experience, such as:
   - Altering the mod for personal enjoyment or to fit your own playstyle.
   - Altering the mod for use in a private server or single-player game, as long as it does not involve redistribution outside of limited personal use.

5. Assisting your own mod development, so long as you do **not** claim authorship or reuse them in a way that misleads others about their origin. See *Restriction 3* below for more details.

#### b. Attribution

ANY reuse or modification of these assets **must** provide clear and visible attribution to the Author.

Transformative changes **should** still credit the Author, but the extent of attribution may be reasonably adjusted based on the nature of the changes.

#### c. Restrictions

1. Redistribution or reuse of the art assets **outside** the context of Vintage Story modding is **not permitted** without prior written permission.
    
2. You may **not** use these assets in a way that implies false authorship or omits proper credit.
    
3. Wholesale redistribution without transformative changes is explicitly disallowed. This includes reuse of the assets in other mods or projects.

#### d. Definition of Transformative Changes

For the purposes of this license, "transformative changes" are defined as:

> Modifications that add substantial new content, purpose, or expression, beyond superficial edits. These must serve a new or expanded purpose in the context of Vintage Story modding.

#### e. Third-Party Assets

Any third-party content included in this project, either as part of development or releases, retains its original license and/or copyright. Users must comply with any terms respective to said content.

Unitentional inclusion of third-party assets does not imply permission to use them outside their original context. If you find any such content, please notify the Author for proper attribution or removal.

#### f. Project Continuation Clause

1. If the Author is absent or unresponsive for more than 12 weeks **AND** over 8 months have passed since the last mod update, the community **may** continue development under these same terms. These timeframes are to be taken as guidelines.

2. Contributions or redistributions as a result of this clause **must** still provide attribution to the original Author.

3. If the Author returns, they **retain** the right to reclaim ownership and control over the project, including any contributions made during their absence.
    - However, the Author **must** respect the contributions made by the community during that time in the form of attribution, in perpetuity, regardless of whether the contributions are still active or not.

#### g. Warranty and Liability

> THESE ASSETS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE ART ASSETS OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE ART ASSETS.
