Special thanks to small_fern and CATASTEROID for their advice and support.

Thanks also goes out to modders on the VS Discord server who helped me figure out minor issues here and there or helped me figure out code stuff.

Credit also goes to small_fern as creator of Geology Additions (https://mods.vintagestory.at/geologyaddons) for allowing use of my own initial modifications to their original textures which I then practically remade from scratch, making heavy use of the original colours as well as colour from real gemstone references, so that Lithocraft can have further integration with GA.
