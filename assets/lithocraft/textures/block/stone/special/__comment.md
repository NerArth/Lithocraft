Some of these are replacements for vanilla textures that seem to be there as placeholders and aren't actually detailed.

Many of these were also originally based on the textures found in item/resource/ungraded of small_fern's Geology Additions so that integration can be made possible, then further modified with a lot of pixel painting.
